      "Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .\n",
      "The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .\n",
      "The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .\n",
      "`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .\n",
      "The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .\n",
      "This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .\n",
      "Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .\n",
      "But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .\n",
      "That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .\n",
      "`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .\n",
      "The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .\n",
      "Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .\n",
      "`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .\n",
      "The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .\n",
      "The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .\n",
      "Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .\n",
      "But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .\n",
      "`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .\n",
      "`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''\n",
      "The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .\n",
      "We 're about to see if advertising works .\n",
      "Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .\n",
      "Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October\n",
      "Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .\n",
      "This time around , they 're moving even faster .\n",
      "PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .\n",
      "Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .\n",
      "Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .\n",
      "It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .\n",
      "Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .\n",
      "The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .\n",
      "This time , the firms were ready .\n",
      "Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .\n",
      "When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .\n",
      "The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . ''\n",
      "A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .\n",
      "`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .\n",
      "`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .\n",
      "It would have been too late to think about on Friday .\n",
      "We had to think about it ahead of time . ''\n",
      "Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .\n",
      "Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''\n",
      "It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .\n",
      "PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .\n",
      "In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .\n",
      "It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations .\n",
      "The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .\n",
      "Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .\n",
      "We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . ''\n",
      "The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .\n",
      "PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .\n",
      "Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .\n",
      "`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .\n",
      "`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''\n",
      "He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited . ''\n",
      "With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .\n",
      "At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .\n",
      "The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .\n",
      "The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example . ''\n",
      "But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .\n",
      "`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .\n",
      "The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .\n",
      "In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .\n",
      "But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .\n",
      "In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .\n",
      "Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .\n",
      "Ad Notes ... .\n",
      "ARNOLD ADVERTISING :\n",
      "Edward Eskandarian , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS/Boston , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop .\n",
      "Terms were n't disclosed .\n",
      "Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .\n",
      "John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .\n",
      "Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area .\n",
      "That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .\n",
      "EDUCATION ADS :\n",
      "A 142-page ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate Elite '' issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis .\n",
      "The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education .\n",
      "The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .\n",
      "You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ?\n",
      "It 's what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .\n",
      "Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .\n",
      "The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .\n",
      "Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do .\n",
      "In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .\n",
      "He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed .\n",
      "So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .\n",
      "`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .\n",
      "On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .\n",
      "Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 .\n",
      "The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision .\n",
      "Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .\n",
      "That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .\n",
      "The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .\n",
      "`` Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig .\n",
      "He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .\n",
      "The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest .\n",
      "The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all .\n",
      "That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .\n",
      "One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .\n",
      "Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .\n",
      "A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .\n",
      "`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .\n",
      "I love 'em both .\n",
      "The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .\n",
      "The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .\n",
      "I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .\n",
      "Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .\n",
      "Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .\n",
      "In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .\n",
      "He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .\n",
      "Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .\n",
      "Not his autograph ; power-hitter McGwire 's .\n",
      "An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation .\n",
      "He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .\n",
      "`` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured .\n",
      "The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .\n",
      "They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .\n",
      "They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .\n",
      "It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .\n",
      "`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .\n",
      "`` I 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold . ''\n",
      "But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .\n",
      "`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .\n",
      "`` That 's baseball .\n",

      "Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .\n",

      "Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million .\n",
      "Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion .\n",
      "The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .\n",
      "NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .\n",
      "The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .\n",
      "Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .\n",
      "In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .\n",
      "These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .\n",
      "In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .\n",
      "Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share .\n",
      "Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion .\n",

      "For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share .\n",
      "Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion .\n",
      "In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .\n",
      "Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .\n",
      "If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?\n",
      "Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?\n",
      "That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .\n",

      "In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .\n",

      "Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .\n",
      "In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .\n",
      "It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .\n",
      "The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .\n",
      "If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .\n",
      "All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .\n",

      "Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''\n",
      "There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .\n",

      "Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment .\n",
      "Yet on matters close to , er , home ...\n",
      "`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues Mr. Colton .\n",
      "`` We 've taken more than our fair share .\n",
      "I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''\n",
      "But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs .\n",
      "It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .\n",
      "Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production .\n",
      "The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .\n",
      "It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless .\n",
      "Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .\n",
      "Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .\n",
      "Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .\n",
      "More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink .\n",
      "The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .\n",
      "The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .\n",
      "All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages .\n",
      "In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . ''\n",
      "It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people .\n",
      "But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .\n",

      "Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .\n",
      "Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald .\n",

      "According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .\n",
      "The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency .\n",
      "But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .\n",
      "Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .\n",
      "French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .\n",
      "Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .\n",

      "The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing .\n",
      "Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .\n",
      "Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .\n",
      "As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .\n",
      "What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up .\n",
      "Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .\n",
      "Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .\n",
      "UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .\n",

      "The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .\n",
      "The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .\n",
      "Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .\n",
      "As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .\n",
      "These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in .\n",
      "Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday .\n",
      "If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?\n",
      "After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .\n",
      "Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?\n",
      "Absolutely not .\n",
      "To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .\n",
      "The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .\n",
      "The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .\n",
      "If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions .\n",
      "Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .\n",
      "Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .\n",
      "The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .\n",
      "If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .\n",
      "If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .\n",
      "The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .\n",
      "Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .\n",
      "Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .\n",
      "Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .\n",

      "But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .\n",
      "On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .\n",

      "What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?\n",
      "If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .\n",
      "The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment .\n",
      "Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .\n",

      "The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .\n",
      "Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .\n",
      "But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?\n",
      "The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .\n",
      "The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .\n",
      "He 's running for governor .\n",
      "Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .\n",
      "That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .\n",
      "The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money .\n",
      "And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .\n",
      "He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .\n",
      "This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .\n",
      "-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-\n",
      "While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through .\n",
      "This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .\n",
      "If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .\n",
      "The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .\n",
      "That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .\n",
      "Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .\n",
      "Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .\n",
      "George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California .\n",
      "And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .\n",
      "This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it .\n",
      "First , there was a death watch .\n",
      "Then exhilaration .\n",

      "While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .\n",

      "Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash .\n",

      "The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .\n",
      "More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .\n",
      "Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .\n",
      "There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .\n",

      "They did n't .\n",
      "The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading .\n",
      "With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .\n",
      "Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall .\n",
      "And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible .\n",
      "All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .\n",
      "The program traders were in there , too , of course .\n",
      "But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions .\n",

      "Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''\n",

      "The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .\n",
      "The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .\n",
      "The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .\n",
      "In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .\n",
      "Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .\n",
      "But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .\n",
      "A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end .\n",
      "The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .\n",
      "`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports .\n",
      "Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .\n",
      "They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .\n",
      "Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .\n",
      "Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .\n",
      "The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .\n",
      "The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression .\n",
      "The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .\n",
      "`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says .\n",
      "A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .\n",
      "In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .\n",
      "It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged .\n",
      "Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .\n",
      "Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns . ''\n",
      "As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .\n",
      "It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .\n",
      "The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .\n",
      "`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .\n",
      "He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .\n",

      "Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .\n",
      "Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase .\n",
      "As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .\n",
      "Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .\n",
      "But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .\n",
      "`` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said .\n",
      "The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ''\n",
      "Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .\n",
      "People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will .\n",
      "That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .\n",
      "The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .\n",
      "Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .\n",
      "Overall , pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year earlier .\n",
      "Richard G. Sim , the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp .\n",
      "The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time .\n",
      "But analysts , while applauding the acquisition , say Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies .\n",
      "Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ 147 million , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems .\n",
      "The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .\n",
      "Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million .\n",
      "Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line .\n",
      "`` The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , '' says F. John Mirek , an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee .\n",
      "The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim .\n",
      "The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .\n",
      "Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 .\n",
      "The stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading .\n",
      "But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of\n",
      "Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .\n",
      "In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .\n",
      "Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .\n",
      "While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says .\n",
      "Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied .\n",
      "He also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared .\n",
      "Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors .\n",
      "`` With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , '' Mr. Sim says .\n",
      "Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts .\n",
      "Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat .\n",
      "When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , '' he says .\n",
      "He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .\n",
      "At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective .\n",
      "He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program .\n",
      "Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 .\n",
      "The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 .\n"
